# Instructions to run the project

- Open terminal and run the following commands:

• npm install

after installing dependencies run:

• npm run dev

- Make sure you are in 'Command Prompt' terminal otherwise when running `npm run dev` command will throw an error.

# What you like about your implementation

- The components created are agnostic, which means you can reuse them wherever you like and it will behave similar to a web component if you assign the correct parameters, avoiding repetitive code and decreasing project bundle.

# What you would change if you were going to do it again

- Probably add new features like click method that would open dialog with more information about current appointment/event, also possibility to add medias on it such as photos/videos, add status of event like: past, processed, finished or similar.

# How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that

- My design decisions were based in different react components found on internet and also on my experience working with this type of feature on my career where I already implemented something correlate.

# How you would test this if you had more time

- I would go through an end to end test scan using Jest or a similar test framework to find out possible issues and compatibility problems throughout browsers. 
Finding UI issues like non-truncated text on lanes or shifting and broken elements would be primal to predict behavior on different screens and devices.
